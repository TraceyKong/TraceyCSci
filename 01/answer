The code inside the while loop will run endlessly until the condition i < number is met. In each loop, the code will test whether number divides i evenly. If it does, it will print i. Either way, it will move on to the next line, which increments i by 1. The process repeats until i becomes 12. The output, or what will be printed will be the following:
2
3
4
6

In other words, this code finds factors of 12
